      <p>Work continues on the CardPeeGee "Vanilla refreshment" intended to replace the CardPeeGee Vanilla browser game from 2015.
      An early prototype has been built with very limited functionality, to demonstrate progress on the refresh project.</p>

  		<p>The original game is also provided for archive purposes - <a href="builds/legacy/builds.html">click here for the original</a>. Although the technology is now obsolete, you might be able to play it in an older browser.</p>
