                <p>A personal showcase/dumping ground for things I have created.</p>
                <p>
                    Right now there are only a few items on show:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://cardpeegee.vaent.uk">cardpeegee.vaent.uk</a> (transferred over from cardpeegee.com)</li>
                        <li><a href="/gallery">vaent.uk/gallery</a> - a selection of my graphic artworks</li>
                        <li><a href="/Snaky/play">vaent.uk/Snaky/play</a> - a simple game you can play in your browser (even on mobile devices)</li>
                    </ul>
                    Over the coming months I'll be adding art, videos and other bits and pieces as and when I come to them.
                </p>
                <p>I'm building the site from the ground up as a coding exercise, so don't hold your breath waiting for anything specific!</p>

                <h1>Why "Vaent"?</h1>
                <p>
                    The original "Vaent" was Vaentorian, a mage character I created in Ultima Online (an old-school fantasy MMORPG).
                    I later adapted the character for other settings and fiction of my own, and started using the name as a general online handle.
                    This site is the next evolutionary stage of that identity.

                <h1>Cookies and privacy</h1>
                <p>
                    I'm committed to being open about any data I collect and giving people control over their own data.
                    I don't currently use any cookies, nor do I collect any personal data from visitors to this site.
                    If that ever changes I'll post an updated statement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've discovered that the hosting service I use is sending some analytic cookies automatically.
                    It collects some data from devices accessing the site, such as the country where the device is located.
                    This is available to me as anonymous, aggregated data (i.e. total number of UK visitors to the site in the last month).
                    I haven't found any way to control this - it's the default behaviour of the hosting service, not something I opt into.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most modern browsers will allow you to specify cookie settings for an individual site.
                    If you prefer not to have those default cookies on your device, feel free to block all cookies from vaent.uk and its subdomains
                    - blocking cookies should not affect normal use of the site.
                    You can also manually delete the cookies which were sent when you first visited the site.
                    You should be able to find instructions online for both of the above processes, which will depend on the browser you use.
