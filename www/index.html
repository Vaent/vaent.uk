                <p>A personal showcase/dumping ground for things I have created.</p>
                <p>
                    Right now the only real content is <a href="https://cardpeegee.vaent.uk">cardpeegee.vaent.uk</a>
                    (which has been transferred over from cardpeegee.com).
                    Over the coming months I'll be adding art, videos and other bits and pieces as and when I come to them.
                </p>
                <p>I'm building the site from the ground up as a coding exercise, so don't hold your breath waiting for anything specific!</p>

                <h1>Why "Vaent"?</h1>
                <p>
                    The original "Vaent" was Vaentorian, a mage character I created in Ultima Online (an old-school fantasy MMORPG).
                    I later adapted the character for other settings and fiction of my own, and started using the name as a general online handle.
                    This site is the next evolutionary stage of that identity.
